          >Bert Jansch</a
        >, who has died aged 67, who had the most sustained influence, not only
        within folk circles, but also on the wider music scene. To Led
        Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, Jansch was "the innovator of the time … so far
        ahead of what anyone else was doing". Johnny Marr of the Smiths
        described Jansch's effect on his musicianship as "massive … one of the
        most influential and intriguing musicians to have come out of the
        British music scene". Other artists he influenced included Paul Simon,
        Donovan and Neil Young, with whom Jansch toured in the US in 2010.

        On stage, he was an introverted, shy, yet riveting solo performer. In
        his early days especially, he was often unkempt on stage and
        unconventional off it – a non-conformist who cared little for personal
        possessions and who often had no fixed address. It was as a member of
        the groundbreaking folk band Pentangle that he first achieved
        recognition beyond the folk scene. Formed in 1967, the band toured
        extensively until 1972, and although all the original members reunited
        in 1982, it was only Jansch and Jacqui McShee who stayed the course
        until the band folded in 1995.
