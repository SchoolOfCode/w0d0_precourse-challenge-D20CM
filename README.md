## Bert Jansch tribute page
### School Of Code pre-course assignment

This page was created as part of the pre-course material for [School Of Code]'s Bootcamp number 8 in Autumn 2021.  
The assignment was to get to grips with the basics of html and css, create a page that fulfilled the user stories from the [Free Code Camp]'s first project, use git to track changes, and use github to share the source code and deploy the page.
I'd done the Free Code Camp assignment when I first got interested in coding in the spring of 2020, and I remember how difficult it felt at the time, so I was interested in how it might feel now I've got a bit more experience under my belt.  As expected, it felt a lot more straightforward this time around, and I was encouraged by the difference in ease and pace since the first time.  

I chose the folk musician [Bert Jansch](http://www.bertjansch.com) as the subject because he is a big musical influence on me personally, and I've recently been learning some of his music.
The text is taken from an obituary in _The Guardian_ (referenced in the footer) and the photo was borrowed from [an article on _The Fretboard Journal_ website](https://www.fretboardjournal.com/features/scottish-enlightenment-refined-art-bert-jansch/).

The Free Code Camp assignment's user stories were as follows:

>Build a Tribute Page - Passed  
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.
>
>Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
>
>You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

>User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
>
>User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
>
>User Story #3: I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
>
>User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
>
>User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
>
>User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
>
>User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to \_blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="\_blank").
>
>User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
>
>User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.
>
>You can build your project by using this CodePen template and clicking Save to create your own pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js.
>
>Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.

I've included the test suite in the page, and it can be accessed through the hamburger icon in the top left - select "Tribute Page" from the drop down menu for the relevant tests.
